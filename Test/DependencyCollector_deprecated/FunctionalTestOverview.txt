    /// Overview of FunctionalTest:
    /// Tests\FunctionalTests\TestApps contains the test applications. The test applications are onboarded with AppInsights SDK (and AIC).
	/// Build them first (Func tests dont build it automatically-it assumes test applications are already built.
    ///     /// ApplicationInsights.config in the test application is modified to send data into a 'fake' end point localhost:8787
    ///
	///        
    /// Steps:
    /// During class initialize
    /// 1) A new appication pool is created where the sample web application will be deployed.
    /// 2) AIInstaller.msi will be installed which installs APMC, and IIS is reset.
    /// 3) An HTTPObserver is created which listens on the fake dataplatform endpoint localhost:8787 (configured in ApplicationInsights.config)
    /// 
    /// Before Each Test
    /// 4) Test application bits are copied to the folder which is configured as root folder for application in step 1.
    /// 5) Fires up requests to those urls in test application which make external dependancy calls.
    /// The external dependancy calls will be monitored by APMC which creates RDD Events and sends to the configured endpoint  
    /// 6) HTTPObserver in step 3, listens for events (in json format) as sent by SDK/AIC.
    /// 7) Validate that this JSON contains the RDDTelemetry Object.
    ///
    /// During class cleanup
    /// 8) The application pool/application etc deployed in step 1 will be deleted.
    /// 9) AIInstaller.msi will be un-installed which removes APMC.(registry changes/GAC assembly removal etc)
    /// 10) HTTPObserver stops listening.
